        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Although part of Colorado was acquired as early as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, it had no organized government until 1850, when parts of the present State were included in New Mexico and Utah Territories.  Colorado was established as a territory in 1861 with its present boundaries, from parts of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Utah Territories.  The 1860 population is the total enumerated within the 1861 boundaries.  Colorado was admitted as a State on August 1, 1876. Present-day Colorado had no census coverage in 1850, and none in 1860 for the portion taken from Utah Territory.</p>
