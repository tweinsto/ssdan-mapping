        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Oklahoma was acquired by the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.  It soon became an area of settlement for various Indian tribes displaced from States farther east, and was known as the Indian Territory although it had various tribal governments rather than a central administration.  Many non-Indians also settled in the area.  Oklahoma Territory was established from a part of the Indian Territory in 1890 and expanded in 1893; the tribal jurisdictions continued in the remainder.  On November 16, 1907 the two parts were admitted as the State of Oklahoma, with substantially the current boundaries.  A dispute about the western boundary was settled in Texas' favor by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1930.</p>
