        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Nebraska was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and became part of Louisiana (later Missouri) Territory.  It was established as a territory in 1854, including extensive areas northwest and west of the present State; it underwent various reductions in area in 1861 and 1863. Nebraska was admitted as a State on March 1, 1867, with nearly its present boundaries.  Its last significant boundary change was the transfer of an area from Dakota Territory in 1882.</p>
