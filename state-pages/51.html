        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Virginia was one of the 13 original States.  Kentucky was part of Virginia until 1792, and a small part of Virginia was included in the District of Columbia from 1791 to 1846.  West Virginia was separated from Virginia in 1862, becoming a State in 1863 and adding two more counties in 1866. Since then Virginia's boundaries have remained essentially unchanged, with slight modifications as early surveys were reviewed and corrected.  Details of the Virginia-Tennessee boundary were not settled until 1901.</p>
