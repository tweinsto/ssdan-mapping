        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Wisconsin was part of the Northwest Territory organized in 1787, then of Indiana Territory (1800).  In 1809 it was included in the new Illinois Territory, except for the northern part of the Door Peninsula, which remained in Indiana Territory.  In 1818 Michigan Territory expanded to include the whole of present-day Wisconsin.  Wisconsin Territory was organized in 1836 and briefly included all of Minnesota and Iowa and the Dakotas east of the Missouri River.  After Iowa Territory was organized in 1838, only northeastern Minnesota, east of the Mississippi River and a line from its source north to the Canadian boundary, remained in Wisconsin Territory. Wisconsin was admitted as a State on May 29, 1848 with essentially its present boundaries.</p>
