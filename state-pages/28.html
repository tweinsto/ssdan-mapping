        <h3>State Notes</h3>
        <p>Most of present-day Mississippi was part of Georgia until the south-central portions of Mississippi and Alabama were established as Mississippi Territory, authorized by Congress in 1798 and agreed to by Georgia in 1802. In 1804, the Territory was expanded to include the northern parts of the two future States.  The Gulf Coast portions were added in 1812, although still in dispute with Spain until 1819.  Mississippi was admitted as a State on December 10, 1817 with essentially its present boundaries.</p>
